# Python-Prime-Numbers-Program
This program is for maths students who are preparing for their maths GCSE'S.
The aim of this program is to check if the students know everything about prime numbers.
For students who have forgotten about either what  prime numbers are or the prime numbers between 1 and 100. This is a quick refresher.
So, the students can achieve 100% in any prime number question which appears in their exam.
